# 📹 Video Chat App

Welcome to the **Video Chat App** — a modern chat application featuring real-time video communication.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦  Installing

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

SSH
```bash
git clone git@github.com:NoelTimVsu/VideoChatApp.git

HTTPS

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

3. Go into the `backend` folder and run `npm install`
```bash

### 🛠 Running the App Locally
Even though the `package.json` file has commands to start the servers, for local development 
it is recommended to go into each folder (`backend` and `frontend`) and running their respective 
command to start the application.

* For `frontend` run `npm run dev`.

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

* For `backend` run `npm run start:dev`
```bash
cd backend
npm run start:dev
```

# Welcome to your organization's demo respository
This code repository (or "repo") is designed to demonstrate the best GitHub has to offer with the least amount of noise.

The repo includes an `index.html` file (so it can render a web page), two GitHub Actions workflows, and a CSS stylesheet dependency.
