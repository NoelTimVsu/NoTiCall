### 🛠 Running the App Locally
Even though the `package.json` file has commands to start the servers, for local development 
it is recommended to go into each folder (`backend` and `frontend`) and running their respective 
command to start the application.

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

* For `backend` run `npm run start:dev`
```bash
cd backend
npm run start:dev
```
